# AutoArimaExplorer
Robust explorer for selecting and validating ARIMA(p, d, q) models in financial (and non-financial) series. Automates hyperparameter scanning, adds stable fitting retries, uses information criteria and diagnostic guardrails (Ljungâ€“Box), and includes rolling-origin OOS validation with error metrics and prediction intervals.
