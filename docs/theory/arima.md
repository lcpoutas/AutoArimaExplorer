# ARIMA — Theory in Practice

ARIMA is the canonical model for short-horizon forecasting when a single series exhibits short-memory dynamics. It marries three ideas:

1. **Autoregression (AR):** today echoes past levels.
2. **Moving Average (MA):** today also echoes past shocks.
3. **Integration (I):** if levels drift, difference them until the mean is stable.

Formally, an **ARIMA(p, d, q)** for a series $x_t$ applies $d$ differences and then fits an ARMA on $\Delta^d x_t$:

$$
\phi(B)\,\Delta^d x_t = \theta(B)\,\varepsilon_t,\qquad \varepsilon_t \stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim} (0,\sigma^2),
$$

with $\phi(B)=1-\phi_1 B-\cdots-\phi_p B^p$ and $\theta(B)=1+\theta_1 B+\cdots+\theta_q B^q$.
Here $B$ is the backshift operator, $B x_t = x_{t-1}$.

## From ARMA to ARIMA (why differencing matters)

A Classical ARMA models assume the series is **weakly stationary**—constant mean/variance and an autocovariance that depends only on the lag. Many economic and financial series aren’t: they drift, trend, or exhibit unit roots. **Differencing** is the bridge from a non-stationary data-generating process to a stationary one that ARMA can legitimately model. That’s the “I” in ARIMA.

### What differencing does (mathematically and intuitively)

The first difference operator is

$$
\nabla x_t = x_t - x_{t-1} = (1 - B)\,x_t,
$$

with $B$ the backshift operator. Applying it $d$ times yields

$$
\nabla^d x_t = (1 - B)^d\,x_t.
$$

* If $x_t$ contains a **unit root** (a root at $z=1$ of the AR polynomial), then $\nabla x_t$ removes that root and typically produces a stationary series.
* Intuition: differencing converts **levels** to **changes**. Deterministic trends become approximately constant shifts; stochastic trends (random walks) become mean-reverting innovations.

When we say ARIMA$(p,d,q)$, we mean that $y_t = \nabla^d x_t$ is well-described by an ARMA$(p,q)$:

$$
\phi(B)\,y_t = \theta(B)\,\varepsilon_t,\qquad \varepsilon_t \sim \text{i.i.d. }(0,\sigma^2).
$$

We model $y_t$ (the differenced series) with ARMA, then **integrate back** (cumulate the forecasts) to obtain predictions for $x_t$.

### How many differences do we need?

There is no prize for over-differencing. We aim for the **smallest $d$** that yields an approximately stationary series:

* **$d=0$**: already stationary in level (common for returns, log-returns).
* **$d=1$**: removes a single unit root (random-walk-like behavior).
* **$d=2$**: rarely necessary; implies acceleration in the level process (e.g., integrated of order two).

Practical decision aids:

* Visual: level series with pronounced drift and ACF that decays **very slowly** suggests differencing; the first difference should look mean-reverting with a rapidly decaying ACF.
* Tests: unit-root tests (ADF) and stationarity checks (KPSS) provide complementary evidence. (We develop the formalities in the *Statistical Concepts* chapter.)
* Residual diagnostics after provisional fits: if ARMA on the differenced series still shows **low-frequency leakage** (residual ACF significant at large lags), you may be under-differenced.

### The cost of differencing (variance and signal)

Differencing is not free:

* It **amplifies high-frequency noise**. For white noise $w_t$, $\nabla w_t = w_t - w_{t-1}$ has variance $2\sigma^2$.
* It **removes low-frequency content** that may be predictive (e.g., smooth trends).
* It reduces effective sample size for estimation and forecasting at the level scale (integration accumulates uncertainty).

Hence the “minimal $d$” principle: take **just enough** differences to achieve stationarity and push the remaining structure into $p$ and $q$.

### Over-differencing vs under-differencing

* **Under-differenced**: residual ACF decays slowly; information criteria push toward larger $p$ to mimic the trend; forecasts may drift spuriously.
* **Over-differenced**: residuals show **negative** autocorrelation at lag 1; the MA part balloons to compensate; forecast intervals widen unnecessarily.

A quick heuristic: if the ACF of $\nabla x_t$ is **strongly negative at lag 1** and otherwise small, you may have over-differenced.

### Drift and deterministic components

With $d=1$, a **drift** term in the differenced model is equivalent to a linear trend in levels. In ARIMA notation this is the constant/trend handling:

* For $d=0$, a constant (trend = 'c') produces a non-zero mean stationary process.
* For $d\ge 1$, including a constant behaves like a **polynomial trend** in levels; many implementations disable lower-order trends automatically to avoid identification issues.

AutoArimaExplorer mirrors this: for $d=0$ it tries with/without constant; for $d\ge 1$ it toggles drift sensibly while respecting identifiability.

### Seasonal differencing (briefly)

If there is seasonal integration—e.g., a unit root at the seasonal frequency—apply **seasonal differencing** $\nabla_s x_t = x_t - x_{t-s}$ possibly in addition to the non-seasonal $\nabla$. Purely non-seasonal ARIMA often mis-specifies such series, leading to stubborn seasonal autocorrelation in residuals. (We treat SARIMA in a dedicated chapter.)

### How differencing interacts with $p$ and $q$

Differencing reshapes the correlation structure:

* Many stochastic trends can be captured either by **higher $p$** in ARMA **or** by **one difference plus smaller $p$**. The latter is usually cleaner and more stable.
* After differencing, expect **short-memory** residual dynamics; $p$ and $q$ should be modest (e.g., 0–3). If you keep needing large $p$/$q$, revisit $d$ (or seasonality, exogenous drivers, or variance dynamics).

### Common data issues (and what differencing can’t fix)

* **Structural breaks / regime shifts**: differencing doesn’t heal breaks; consider break detection, dummy variables, or regime-switching models.
* **Heteroskedasticity** (volatility clustering): differencing mean structure doesn’t remove conditional variance dynamics; consider GARCH-type or robust errors. (Our residual **squared** Ljung–Box check is a quick proxy.)
* **Nonlinearities**: if dynamics depend on the state (thresholds, saturations), linear ARIMA may be systematically biased.
* **Strong seasonality or calendar effects**: handle seasonality explicitly; differencing alone is crude.

### Practical diagnostics you’ll see in this project

AutoArimaExplorer enforces a few disciplined checks:

* **Ljung–Box on residuals** (and optionally on squared residuals): if differencing and ARMA are doing their job, residual autocorrelation—especially at low lags—should be statistically negligible.
* **Information criteria** (AIC/BIC): used to balance fit and parsimony on the differenced series.
* **Competing $d$**: we explicitly compare $d \in \{0,1,2\}$, letting diagnostics, not habit, choose the level of integration.

### Bottom line

ARIMA is not “ARMA but fancier”—it’s **ARMA on the right scale**. Correct differencing is the decisive step that turns drifting, unit-rooty level data into a stable signal where short-memory ARMA can do honest work. Get $d$ right, and $p$ and $q$ become small, interpretable, and forecast-useful; get $d$ wrong, and the rest is damage control.

## Stationarity & Invertibility (the root picture)

ARIMA models live or die by the location of a few complex numbers. The most useful way to reason about **stationarity** (for the AR part) and **invertibility** (for the MA part) is to look at the **roots** of their characteristic polynomials in the complex plane.

### The two polynomials

For an ARMA$(p,q)$ model on a (differenced) series $y_t$,

$$
\phi(B)\,y_t \;=\; \theta(B)\,\varepsilon_t,\qquad \varepsilon_t\sim\text{i.i.d. }(0,\sigma^2),
$$

with

$$
\phi(B)=1-\phi_1 B-\cdots-\phi_p B^p,\qquad
\theta(B)=1+\theta_1 B+\cdots+\theta_q B^q.
$$

* **AR stationarity:** All roots of $\phi(z)=0$ must lie **outside** the unit circle $\{|z|>1\}$.
* **MA invertibility:** All roots of $\theta(z)=0$ must lie **outside** the unit circle $\{|z|>1\}$.

These conditions guarantee:

- A **stable** moving-average representation $y_t=\sum_{k\ge 0}\psi_k \varepsilon_{t-k}$ with absolutely summable $\{\psi_k\}$,
- A **unique** innovation process (no observationally equivalent “non-invertible” parameterizations).

> In ARIMA$(p,d,q)$, the differenced series $y_t=\nabla^d x_t$ should satisfy the ARMA root conditions above. The unit roots associated with $(1-B)^d$ live *on* the unit circle by design—that’s the “I” you chose to difference away.

### Quick intuition with AR(1) and MA(1)

* **AR(1):** $y_t=\phi y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$.
  $\phi(z)=1-\phi z\Rightarrow z=1/\phi$. Stationary iff $|\phi|<1$ (root at $|z|>1$).
* **MA(1):** $y_t=\varepsilon_t+\theta \varepsilon_{t-1}$.
  $\theta(z)=1+\theta z\Rightarrow z=-1/\theta$. Invertible iff $|\theta|<1$.

A useful mental model: **the closer a root is to the unit circle**, the more **persistent** (slowly decaying) the correlation pattern. Cross the circle and persistence becomes explosive (AR) or the innovations become non-unique (MA).

### The geometry: what roots “mean”

* **Real roots $r>1$ (AR):** slow, monotone decay in the ACF (persistence).
  Roots near $1^+$ ↔ very long memory in mean.
* **Real roots $r<-1$ (AR):** alternating-sign decay (oscillations with period \~2).
* **Complex conjugate roots $re^{\pm i\omega}$ (AR):** damped cycles with angular frequency $\omega$ and damping $r^{-k}$. Period $\approx 2\pi/\omega$.
* **MA roots** control **invertibility** and the shape of the **ACF at small lags**; non-invertible parameterizations have an equivalent invertible twin (flip a root $z$ inside the unit circle to its reciprocal $1/\bar z$) producing the *same* second-order behavior but a different innovation sequence. That’s why we *enforce* invertibility: it’s a normalization for uniqueness.

### Why roots near 1 are troublesome

Roots that **hug** the unit circle cause:

* **Numerical fragility** (flat likelihood; optimizer plateaus).
* **Huge forecast persistence** (wide intervals, slow mean reversion).
* **Diagnostic confusion**: residual autocorrelation decays so slowly that Ljung–Box rejects unless you difference or simplify.

Practically, if an AR root is very close to $1$ (or a seasonal root to $e^{2\pi i/s}$), you probably need **(seasonal) differencing** rather than higher-order AR terms.

### ARIMA and unit roots

ARIMA explicitly factors unit roots into $(1-B)^d$. The **stationarity** condition applies to the *remaining* AR polynomial $\phi$. Equivalently:

$$
(1-B)^d\,\phi(B)\,x_t=\theta(B)\,\varepsilon_t,\quad
\text{with }\phi(z)\text{ root-outside and }\theta(z)\text{ root-outside.}
$$

So the differenced process is stationary/invertible, while the level process has $d$ unit roots by construction.

### Companion matrix view (for the linear-algebra inclined)

Let $A$ be the AR companion matrix. Stationarity is equivalent to the **spectral radius** $\rho(A)<1$. This is the same “root outside the unit circle” condition in matrix clothing and explains why near-unit roots create near-unit eigenvalues—ill-conditioned likelihoods and fragile estimates.

### Practical diagnostics & safeguards you’ll see

* **Root checks:** It’s good practice to compute AR & MA roots post-fit and confirm $|z|>1$ with margin. Roots with $|z|\approx 1$ merit simpler models or differencing.
* **Constraints in fitting:** Many libraries (including what we leverage) can **enforce stationarity/invertibility** during optimization. AutoArimaExplorer tries both constrained and unconstrained trials and keeps the best admissible fit.
* **Ljung–Box (residuals & squared residuals):** If roots are well-behaved, residual autocorrelation should be negligible. Persistent low-lag structure often points to roots too close to 1 (or missing seasonality/exogenous drivers).

### Common patterns to recognize

* **Under-differenced:** AR roots estimated **very near 1**; slow ACF tail; models prefer large $p$. Fix with differencing.
* **Over-differenced:** Strong **negative** lag-1 ACF; MA balloons to compensate. Reduce $d$.
* **Non-invertible MA:** Coefficients imply $|z|\le 1$ for some MA root; flip to the invertible representation (libraries usually do this or we reject such trials).

> For formal definitions of weak stationarity, Wold decomposition, absolute summability, and asymptotic properties, see the **Statistical Concepts** chapter. Here, the rule of thumb is simple: **keep all AR and MA roots comfortably outside the unit circle**, and your ARIMA will behave like a stable linear filter rather than a barely-tamed random walk.

## The role of constants, trends, and drift

A surprisingly large share of ARIMA modeling comes down to a small choice: **do we include a deterministic level or slope?** In practice this shows up as a **constant** (intercept), a **linear trend**, or, after differencing, a **drift**. Getting this right determines long-run behavior and the shape of your forecasts.

### ARMA: constants set the long-run mean

For a stationary ARMA$(p,q)$ model on $y_t$,

$$
y_t \;=\; c \;+\; \sum_{i=1}^{p}\phi_i\,y_{t-i} \;+\; \varepsilon_t \;+\; \sum_{j=1}^{q}\theta_j\,\varepsilon_{t-j},
\quad \varepsilon_t\stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim}(0,\sigma^2),
$$

the unconditional mean exists and equals

$$
\mu \;=\; \frac{c}{\,1-\sum_{i=1}^{p}\phi_i\,}.
$$

* If you **omit** $c$ (trend='n'), you force $\mu=0$. That’s often appropriate for **returns**.
* If you **include** $c$ (trend='c'), the process **mean-reverts** to $\mu$, and multi-step forecasts flatten toward $\mu$.

**Heuristic:** For $d=0$, use no constant when working with demeaned data or near-zero-mean returns; allow a constant at levels if a nonzero mean is plausible.

### From ARMA to ARIMA: why “drift” appears

In ARIMA$(p,d,q)$ we model $x_t$ through $d$-th differences $y_t = \nabla^{d} x_t$ that follow ARMA$(p,q)$. Deterministic terms transform under differencing:

* A **constant** in levels disappears after **one** difference.
* A **linear trend** in levels becomes a **constant (drift)** after one difference.
* In general, a polynomial trend of degree $m$ in levels becomes a polynomial of degree $m-d$ (or vanishes if $m<d$) in the differenced series.

For the common $d=1$ case (random-walk-like levels), you’ll see **drift**:

$$
\nabla x_t \equiv x_t - x_{t-1} \;=\; \delta \;+\; \text{ARMA}(p,q)\text{ noise}.
$$

Equivalently, $x_t$ is a **random walk with drift $\delta$** plus stationary noise. Its expectation is linear:

$$
\mathbb{E}[x_t] \;=\; x_0 \;+\; \delta\,t.
$$

Forecasts inherit a **linear slope** $\delta$: long-horizon point forecasts march upward (or downward) at rate $\delta$, while uncertainty widens with horizon.

### What your software’s “trend” flag really means

Most libraries expose deterministic terms via a `trend` argument:

* `trend='n'` — no deterministic term.
* `trend='c'` — constant (intercept).
* `trend='t'` — linear time trend.
* `trend='ct'` — both constant and trend (when identifiable).

**Crucial constraint (identifiability):**
When you difference $d$ times, **trend terms of order < $d$** are **not** identifiable (they are annihilated by differencing) and should be omitted. Concretely:

* With **$d=0$**: you may use `'n'`, `'c'`, `'t'`, or `'ct'` as appropriate.
* With **$d=1$**: a pure constant in levels vanishes, but a **linear trend in levels** corresponds to **drift in $\nabla x_t$**. Use `'t'` (not `'c'`). Many libraries will warn or silently drop invalid terms.
* With **$d\ge 2$**: only higher-order trends survive; in most practical ARIMA work, you set `'n'` unless you explicitly model higher-order polynomials.

> Mapping tip: “**drift**” in the differenced equation is equivalent to selecting a **linear trend in levels** (e.g., `trend='t'` when $d=1$). A plain intercept (`'c'`) is appropriate for $d=0$ but not for $d=1$.

### Forecast behavior: mean reversion vs. linear growth

* **ARMA with constant (d=0):** forecasts **revert** to $\mu$.
* **ARIMA with drift (d=1):** forecasts **grow linearly** with slope $\delta$.
* **No deterministic term:** forecasts revert to **zero** (d=0) or to the **last level** (random walk without drift, $d=1$).

Choose the specification that matches domain knowledge:

* Financial prices → often **$d=1$** with **no drift** unless there’s structural growth.
* Macroeconomic levels (e.g., GDP) → **$d=1$** and **drift** is common.
* Stationary spreads/returns → **$d=0$** with or without a **constant** depending on the mean.

### Common pitfalls and how to spot them

* **Including an intercept when $d=1$:** it’s not identified; your library will warn or drop it. Use `'t'` (drift) instead if a slope is justified.
* **Spurious trends:** an apparent slope driven by a short sample or regime shift. Check stability (rolling estimates) and use out-of-sample validation.
* **Over-deterministic modeling:** a strong linear trend plus AR terms can overfit; let differencing and AR capture persistence unless a trend is truly structural.
* **Forecast pathology:** If long-horizon forecasts explode or hug the last observation implausibly, revisit the deterministic term: you may need to add/drop **drift** or switch between `'c'` and `'n'`.

### Quick decision guide

1. **Is the working series stationary (after your chosen differencing)?**
    - Yes ($d=0$) → Consider a **constant** only if the mean is materially nonzero.
    - No ($d=1$) → Consider **drift** (via `trend='t'`) if a linear trend in levels is credible.
  
2. **Do forecasts need a long-run level or slope?**

    - Level (mean reversion) → constant at $d=0$.
    - Slope (steady growth/decline) → drift at $d=1$.

3. **Do diagnostics agree?**

    - Intercept/drift significant; BIC improves; residuals pass Ljung–Box → keep it.
    - Otherwise, prefer the simpler deterministic structure.

## Forecasts and uncertainty

Forecasting with ARIMA is more than a point prediction. We also need a **distribution** for the future, because decisions hinge on how wide the plausible range is. This section lays out (i) how ARIMA point forecasts are formed, (ii) how forecast **errors** accumulate with the horizon, and (iii) how to build **prediction intervals** (PIs)—including the caveats that matter in practice.

### Point forecasts via the MA(∞) view

Any causal ARMA$(p,q)$ (and thus any ARIMA once you difference) admits an MA(∞) representation

$$
y_t \;=\; \mu + \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\psi_j \,\varepsilon_{t-j}, 
\qquad \psi_0=1,\quad \sum_j|\psi_j|<\infty,
$$

with $\varepsilon_t \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim}(0,\sigma^2)$ and $\psi(B)=\frac{\theta(B)}{\phi(B)}$. For horizon $h\ge 1$,

$$
\widehat{y}_{t}(h) \;\equiv\; \mathbb{E}[y_{t+h}\mid \mathcal{F}_t]
\;=\; \mu + \sum_{j=h}^{\infty}\psi_j \,\varepsilon_{t+h-j},
$$

since future shocks ($j<h$) have zero mean. In practice, software computes $\widehat{y}_t(h)$ by **recursion** in the ARIMA state or by using the MA(∞) weights; both yield the same predictor.

* **ARMA (stationary)**: forecasts **mean revert** to $\mu$.
* **ARIMA with $d=1$**: if the differenced series has a **drift** $\delta$, levels follow a random-walk-like path and point forecasts grow linearly: $\widehat{x}_{t}(h) \approx x_t + \delta\,h$ (plus ARMA adjustments).

### Forecast error variance (why bands widen)

Define the $h$-step forecast error $e_t(h) = y_{t+h}-\widehat{y}_t(h)$. For ARMA,

$$
e_t(h) \;=\; \sum_{j=0}^{h-1}\psi_j\,\varepsilon_{t+h-j},
\qquad
\operatorname{Var}[e_t(h)] \;=\; \sigma^2 \sum_{j=0}^{h-1}\psi_j^2.
$$

Key implications:

* The **one-step** error variance is $\sigma^2$.
* As $h$ grows, the partial sum $\sum_{j=0}^{h-1}\psi_j^2$ **increases**, so intervals widen.
* For **ARIMA** with differencing ($d\ge 1$), the variance of **levels** grows **without bound**:

  * Random walk ($d=1$, no drift): $\operatorname{Var}[x_{t}(h)-x_t] = \sigma^2 h$.
  * Random walk with drift: **same variance**; drift affects the **mean**, not the spread.

More generally, if $\psi(B) = \theta(B)/\phi(B)$ and the roots of $\phi(z)$ are outside the unit circle (stationarity), $\psi_j$ is absolutely summable and $\sum_{j=0}^{h-1}\psi_j^2$ stabilizes as $h\to\infty$ for **ARMA**. With **integration** ($d\ge 1$), differencing introduces an additional accumulation that pushes level-forecast variance upward with $h$.

### Prediction intervals (PIs) vs. confidence intervals (CIs)

* A **prediction interval** aims to cover the **future observation**, not the (unknown) mean. Under Gaussian innovations,

  $$
  \text{PI}_{1-\alpha}(h):\quad \widehat{y}_t(h) \;\pm\; z_{1-\alpha/2}\,\sqrt{\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}[e_t(h)]},
  $$

  where $\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}[e_t(h)]$ comes from the model and $z_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the standard normal quantile.
* A **confidence interval** for the **forecast mean** is narrower; it ignores the one-step-ahead innovation term and (in ARIMA) is rarely what you want for decisions.

**Coverage caveat.** Standard PIs typically **ignore parameter uncertainty** (estimation error in $\phi,\theta,\sigma^2$). With short samples or highly persistent dynamics, nominal 95% PIs can **under-cover**. Two remedies:

1. **Simulation (parametric bootstrap)**: simulate many future paths using the estimated model; take empirical quantiles at each horizon.
2. **Asymptotic adjustment**: add a term derived from the delta method and the parameter covariance; rarely implemented in general ARIMA stacks.

### Drift and long-horizon behavior

For $d=1$ with **drift** $\delta$, level forecasts step forward at slope $\delta$:

$$
\widehat{x}_t(h) \;=\; x_t + \delta\,h + \text{ARMA corrections}.
$$

Uncertainty is driven by the **integrated noise**, so the **fan chart** widens roughly like $\sqrt{h}$ for a random walk. If you see bands that do **not** widen in $d=1$ levels, you are likely looking at intervals for **differences** rather than **levels**, or a misreported variance.

### Non-Gaussian and heteroskedastic shocks

PIs above assume **i.i.d. Gaussian** innovations with **constant variance**. Real data often deviate:

* **Heavy tails / outliers**: the normal-quantile recipe leads to **undercoverage**. Use robust quantiles via simulation or fit a heavier-tailed noise.
* **Conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH/GARCH)**: variance **evolves over time**, so $\operatorname{Var}[e_t(h)]$ depends on the current volatility state. Remedies:

  * Model volatility explicitly (ARIMA-GARCH).
  * Or transform to stabilize variance (e.g., log-returns), then model.

### Transforms and back-transforms

If you model a **transformed series** $g(x_t)$ (logs, Box–Cox, differencing), take care when **back-transforming** forecasts and intervals:

* **Log scale**: if $y_t=\log x_t$ and $\widehat{y}_t(h)\sim \mathcal{N}(m,s^2)$, the unbiased mean on the original scale is $\exp(m+\tfrac12 s^2)$ (log-normal correction). Applying $\exp$ naively to the endpoints of a symmetric PI on log scale yields an **asymmetric** PI on the original scale—this is **correct** and expected.
* **Differencing**: level forecasts are obtained by **integrating** the predicted differences; the variance aggregates across steps, hence wider bands.

### Practical checklist

1. **Pick the horizon**: Decide whether you need PIs for **differences** (flows) or **levels** (stocks).
2. **Use the right deterministic term**: drift in $d=1$ if a linear trend in levels is plausible; otherwise omit it.
3. **Report PIs, not just points**: Use model-based variance; for short samples or high persistence, prefer **simulation-based** bands.
4. **Stress test coverage**: Backtest PIs; aim for nominal coverage (e.g., \~95%). Tools like the **Winkler score** or empirical coverage by horizon help quantify calibration.
5. **Mind volatility**: If residuals show ARCH effects, expect undercoverage with homoskedastic ARIMA; consider ARIMA-GARCH or variance-stabilizing transforms.
6. **Communicate widening**: Stakeholders should expect wider uncertainty at longer horizons—especially for integrated processes.

## When ARIMA works best

ARIMA shines when your series is well-explained by **linear, short-memory dynamics** after a **small amount of differencing**. In that regime, it delivers sharp short-to-medium-term forecasts, interpretable parameters, and well-calibrated uncertainty—without the overhead of complex models.

### The sweet spot (data properties)

ARIMA is a strong choice when most of the following hold:

* **Regular sampling & enough history.** Observations at a fixed cadence (no big gaps), with at least **\~100–200 points** for stable estimation and diagnostics.
* **Low-order integration.** One difference (occasionally two) stabilizes level/variance and removes obvious trends; differenced series looks roughly stationary.
* **Short-range dependence.** Autocorrelations decay quickly; PACF/ACF suggest low orders (small $p,q$).
* **Variance is stable (or can be stabilized).** Raw scale is homoskedastic, or becomes so after a simple transform (log, Box–Cox).
* **No strong seasonality** (or it’s handled explicitly with SARIMA). The nonseasonal ARIMA part is for the “within-season” dynamics.
* **No frequent regime shifts.** Mean/variance don’t jump around due to structural breaks; interventions are infrequent and can be modeled separately.
* **Innovations not too wild.** Residuals are roughly Gaussian with thin/moderate tails; outliers are occasional rather than the rule.

> When these ingredients line up, ARIMA tends to produce forecasts that are hard to beat with much heavier machinery.

### Typical winning use cases

* **Differenced levels with drift.** Economic indicators, demand/consumption, web traffic, or price levels where $\nabla x_t$ behaves like a weakly-dependent process and a **drift** captures the average trend.
* **Return-like series.** Financial/crypto **log-returns**: mean \~0, short memory, good fit with ARMA (often $p,q \le 2$). If volatility clusters strongly, consider ARIMA-GARCH.
* **Operational short-term demand.** Call volumes, ticket arrivals, inventory withdrawals—once detrended (and deseasonalized if needed), ARIMA captures day-to-day dynamics.
* **Post-processing of ML forecasts.** ARIMA on **residuals** of a baseline model (hybrid ARIMA-X) to mop up linear autocorrelation left on the table.

### Signals ARIMA is a good idea (quick checklist)

* **After differencing:** ACF tails off quickly; PACF has a few significant spikes only.
* **Diagnostics:** Residuals pass **Ljung–Box** at standard lags; no obvious structure in residual ACF/PACF; variance looks flat over time.
* **Parsimony:** Small $p,q$ give you most of the performance; adding lags doesn’t materially reduce BIC or OOS error.
* **Stable parameters:** Re-fits on rolling windows yield similar coefficients and forecast error profiles.

> Tip: In AutoArimaExplorer, these checks are automated via BIC selection, Ljung–Box guardrails, and optional out-of-sample (rolling) validation.

### Where ARIMA is not your first pick (and what to do)

* **Strong seasonality or calendar effects.** Use **SARIMA** (seasonal terms), or decompose first (STL, calendar regressors) and ARIMA the remainder.
* **Time-varying volatility.** Clear ARCH/GARCH signatures → consider **ARIMA-GARCH** or variance-stabilizing transforms.
* **Nonlinear dynamics / regime changes.** Markov-switching, threshold effects, structural breaks → look at **state-switching models** or tree/NN methods with change-point handling.
* **Exogenous drivers dominate.** If weather, price, promotions, or macro covariates explain most variance, use **ARIMAX** (ARIMA with regressors) or a pure regression with autocorrelated errors.
* **Sparse/irregular sampling.** Consider state-space models with missing-data handling, or continuous-time alternatives.
* **Very long horizons.** Integrated processes accumulate uncertainty fast; for long-range planning, pair ARIMA with scenario analysis or hierarchical/aggregated signals.

### Practical edge cases (and easy fixes)

* **(1,1,1) looks “too simple.”** That’s often fine—short memory is real. If residuals still show structure, try small increments (e.g., $(2,1,1)$ or $(1,1,2)$), but accept **parsimony** when BIC and diagnostics agree.
* **Heteroskedastic residuals but mild.** Keep ARIMA for the mean, use **robust errors** or widen PIs via simulation; only escalate to GARCH if coverage suffers.
* **Drift vs. constant confusion.** With $d=1$, use **drift** (not a level constant). With $d=0$, use a **constant** if the mean is nonzero.
* **Outliers.** Winsorize or add intervention dummies; otherwise a few spikes can spoil inference and intervals.

### How AutoArimaExplorer exploits this regime

* **Two natural working series.** Levels standardized for $d\ge 1$; log-returns for $d=0$.
* **Robust fitting policy.** Multiple estimation “trials” (innovations MLE / state space, with/without constraints) and selection by **BIC**.
* **Guardrails by design.** Residual **Ljung–Box** (mean, optionally squared), finite-BIC checks, and convergence enforcement.
* **Flexible selection.** Best-by-BIC, best-by-$q$ (parsimonious within each MA order), and **rolling OOS** selection with RMSE/MAE/MAPE or Winkler score for interval calibration.

> If your data match the sweet-spot properties above, ARIMA—and by extension AutoArimaExplorer—will likely give you **fast, interpretable, and reliable** forecasts. For everything else, ARIMA remains a solid **baseline** and a powerful **diagnostic lens** to understand what additional structure (seasonality, exogenous signals, volatility, regimes) you may need.

Here’s a ready-to-paste chapter.

## Limitations and common data issues

ARIMA is a powerful baseline, but it has clear failure modes. Knowing them—and how to mitigate them—will save you time and misleading forecasts.

### 1) Structural breaks and regime shifts

**Symptom.** Sudden level/variance changes, policy interventions, product launches, outages. Residual ACF shows leftover structure; parameters drift across time.

**Why ARIMA struggles.** It assumes fixed linear dynamics. Breaks violate stationarity and parameter constancy.

**What to do.**

* Detect/mark breaks (change-point tests, domain knowledge) and add **intervention dummies**.
* Fit on **post-break** segments or use **rolling re-estimation**.
* Consider **regime-switching** or time-varying parameter state-space models if shifts are frequent.

### 2) Seasonality and calendar effects

**Symptom.** ACF spikes at seasonal lags (e.g., 7, 24, 12), weekday/holiday patterns.

**Why ARIMA struggles.** Nonseasonal ARIMA can’t encode long-period cyclic dependence.

**What to do.**

* Use **SARIMA** (seasonal ARIMA) or deseasonalize via **STL/Prophet-style decomposition** and model the remainder.
* Add **calendar regressors** (dow, holiday flags) with ARIMA errors (ARIMAX).

### 3) Heteroskedasticity (time-varying volatility)

**Symptom.** Residuals pass mean autocorrelation tests but **squared residuals** are autocorrelated; prediction intervals too narrow in volatile regimes.

**Why ARIMA struggles.** It models the conditional mean, not the variance.

**What to do.**

* Variance-stabilizing transforms (log, Box–Cox).
* Pair with **GARCH** (ARIMA-GARCH) or use robust/quantile methods for intervals.

### 4) Nonlinearity and long memory

**Symptom.** Smooth trends, thresholds, saturations, persistence that decays very slowly (hyperbolic ACF).

**Why ARIMA struggles.** Linear, short-memory structure can’t capture nonlinear response or fractional integration.

**What to do.**

* Add nonlinear terms via **exogenous regressors** or switch to **tree/NN** models with temporal features.
* For long memory, consider **ARFIMA**.

### 5) Outliers and heavy tails

**Symptom.** Spikes that dominate fit; residuals with fat tails; unstable parameters.

**Why ARIMA struggles.** MLE is sensitive to extremes; a few points can swing coefficients and BIC.

**What to do.**

* Winsorize/clean or model **interventions** explicitly.
* Use robust estimation or downweight outliers; validate with **rolling OOS** metrics.

### 6) Missing data and irregular sampling

**Symptom.** Gaps, uneven time steps, duplicated timestamps.

**Why ARIMA struggles.** Standard estimation assumes a regular grid.

**What to do.**

* Impute to a **regular cadence** (carry-forward, interpolation, model-based) or use state-space Kalman filtering that tolerates missingness.
* Aggregate/disaggregate carefully; avoid mixing frequencies.

### 7) Over-/under-differencing

**Symptom.**

* **Under-differenced:** residual ACF shows slow decay; unit-root tests reject stationarity.
* **Over-differenced:** negative lag-1 ACF, overdamped dynamics, loss of signal.

**What to do.**

* Use **unit-root tests** (ADF/PP/KPSS; see *Statistical Concepts* chapter) and inspect ACF/PACF on differenced series.
* Prefer the **lowest differencing** that yields stationarity; consider drift when $d=1$.

### 8) Near nonstationarity / invertibility (unit-root edges)

**Symptom.** AR or MA roots close to the unit circle; large standard errors; convergence warnings.

**Why ARIMA struggles.** Likelihood surface is flat near boundary; estimates unstable.

**What to do.**

* Enforce **stationarity/invertibility** constraints during fitting (then relax if needed).
* Favor **parsimonious** models; re-test on rolling windows.

### 9) Identifiability and multicollinearity of lags

**Symptom.** Many AR/MA terms but similar fit; inflated standard errors; BIC barely improves.

**Why ARIMA struggles.** Redundant lags create parameter collinearity.

**What to do.**

* Keep $p,q$ **small**; let **BIC** and **OOS** validation prune.
* Inspect ACF/PACF for **minimal** useful orders.

### 10) Exogenous drivers omitted

**Symptom.** Forecasts miss systematic effects (price, weather, promotions); residuals correlate with known signals.

**What to do.**

* Use **ARIMAX** with relevant regressors and keep ARMA terms for the residual autocorrelation.

### 11) Small samples

**Symptom.** Unstable estimates; diagnostics inconclusive.

**What to do.**

* Limit orders (e.g., $p,q \le 2$), use **BIC** over AIC, and consider **hierarchical pooling** or simpler baselines.

### 12) Long-horizon forecasts

**Symptom.** Intervals explode; mean reverts too fast/slow relative to reality.

**Why ARIMA struggles.** Uncertainty accumulates quickly in integrated processes.

**What to do.**

* Communicate **scenario ranges**; refresh with **rolling re-fits**; blend with structural or causal models for long-term planning.

---

### Practical caveats (tooling & diagnostics)

* **Convergence & warnings.** “Non-stationary AR starts” / “Non-invertible MA starts” are common; they usually trigger robust initialization. True **non-convergence** is a red flag—tighten constraints, reduce orders, or change optimizer settings.
* **Data leakage.** Don’t tune on the full series and report naive test error. Use **rolling-origin** validation.
* **Multiple testing.** Large grids inflate false positives. Penalize with **BIC**, and confirm with **OOS** metrics and residual diagnostics.
* **Diagnostics to rely on.** ACF/PACF, **Ljung–Box** (mean, and squared residuals for volatility), unit-root tests, parameter stability, and coverage of prediction intervals. Detailed definitions and procedures live in the *Statistical Concepts* chapter.

---

### How AutoArimaExplorer mitigates these issues

* **Guardrails:** Convergence enforcement, **finite-BIC** checks, and **Ljung–Box** filters (mean ± optional squared).
* **Parsimony by default:** BIC-driven selection, tie-breaks favoring lower $p+q$.
* **Rolling OOS:** Optional **out-of-sample** scoring (RMSE/MAE/MAPE or **Winkler** for interval calibration).
* **Flexible preprocessing:** Work on **log-returns** for $d=0$ and **standardized levels** for $d\ge 1$; easy to add calendar/exogenous features in downstream workflows.

## Practical identification heuristics (modeling playbook)

This is a pragmatic, battle-tested checklist you can follow before, during, and after running ARIMA. It blends classic Box–Jenkins rules with modern validation habits. Use it linearly the first time; later you’ll jump around.

### 0) Sanity checks & cleaning

* **Cadence:** enforce a regular time step; resample if needed.
* **Missing:** impute sensibly (interpolate short gaps, domain-aware fill for long gaps).
* **Outliers:** flag large spikes; either explain (events) or winsorize/mark with dummies.
* **Scale/units:** if the series is strictly positive and multiplicative, consider **log** (or Box–Cox).

---

### 1) First look

* Plot levels and first differences; annotate obvious breaks/seasonality.
* Inspect a quick **ACF/PACF** of levels and of first differences.
* Compute rolling mean/variance to spot heteroskedasticity.

---

### 2) Make it stationary (choose $d$)

* If levels show slow persistence and ACF decays very slowly → **difference once** ($d=1$).
* If still non-stationary (trend in mean), test again; rarely $d=2$ is justified.
* **Avoid over-differencing:** if you see a strong negative lag-1 ACF in the differenced series, you likely went too far.
* If $d=1$, consider allowing a **drift** (constant after differencing) unless domain knowledge says otherwise.

> Minimal differencing that achieves stationarity beats aggressive differencing.

---

### 3) Seasonal structure (if applicable)

* ACF spikes at lag $s$ and multiples (e.g., 7, 12, 24) → consider **seasonal differencing** $D=1$ and a **SARIMA** (not covered in this chapter), or pre-deseasonalize with STL and model the remainder.

---

### 4) Choose small candidate orders ($p, q$)

Use the differenced (stationary) series’ ACF/PACF as a **guide**, not a law:

* **AR($p$) hint:** PACF cuts off after $p$; ACF tails off.
* **MA($q$) hint:** ACF cuts off after $q$; PACF tails off.
* **ARMA($p,q$) hint:** both ACF and PACF tail off.

Start with a **small grid**: $p,q \in \{0,1,2\}$. Favor parsimony.

---

### 5) Fit & compare (in-sample guardrails)

For each candidate:

* Fit with constraints to enforce **stationarity/invertibility** (relax only if needed).
* Check:

  * **Convergence:** must be true (don’t negotiate this).
  * **BIC:** prefer the smallest; use AIC only for exploratory tie-breaks.
  * **Residual diagnostics:** Ljung–Box on residuals (no autocorrelation). Optionally test **squared residuals** to screen for short-range volatility (ARCH-like behavior).

**Stopping rules (handy):**

* Only accept a more complex model if BIC drops by **≥ 2** (or your chosen threshold).
* If LB fails, **discard** regardless of BIC.

---

### 6) Cross-validate (out-of-sample reality check)

* Run **rolling-origin** evaluation with a short horizon (e.g., 1–5 steps).
* Score with **RMSE/MAE/MAPE**; for interval quality use the **Winkler score**.
* Prefer the model that is competitive on BIC **and** clearly best OOS. If BIC and OOS disagree, trust **OOS**.

---

### 7) Volatility & intervals

* If residuals pass LB but **squared residuals** fail LB → variance is time-varying.
* Expect under-covered prediction intervals; consider variance-stabilizing transforms (log/Box–Cox) or pairing with **GARCH** for volatility.

---

### 8) Edge/boundary situations

* **Near-unit roots:** parameters unstable, big SEs, optimizer warnings. Prefer simpler $p,q$; re-estimate on rolling windows.
* **Identifiability:** if adding lags barely improves BIC and parameters are wobbly, prune back.

---

### 9) Checklist for “good” ARIMA

* Converged fit ✔
* Smallest (or near-smallest) **BIC** among parsimonious candidates ✔
* Residual **Ljung–Box** (mean) passes at multiple lags ✔
* (Optional) **LB on squared residuals** passes for short-range lags ✔
* Reasonable, stable coefficients (no wild standard errors) ✔
* **Rolling OOS** error competitive or best ✔
* Intervals with plausible coverage ✔

---

### A tiny ACF/PACF cheat-sheet

* **AR(1):** PACF spike at lag 1 then \~0; ACF decays geometrically.
* **MA(1):** ACF spike at lag 1 then \~0; PACF decays geometrically.
* **ARMA(1,1):** Both ACF and PACF decay (no sharp cut-off).
* **Over-differenced:** strong negative ACF at lag 1.

---

### What this looks like in practice with AutoArimaExplorer

* Use **`fit_grid`** on a small, sensible grid; force **`require_converged=True`**.
* Select with **`select_best_by_bic`** (enable LB guardrail; optionally `check_sq=True`).
* Cross-check with **`select_by_oos`** (rolling origin) on the finalists.
* If LB on squared residuals fails repeatedly, consider a transform or volatility model.
* Keep models **simple** unless there is clear BIC **and** OOS justification.

> Rule of thumb: if a model is only microscopically better in-sample but worse OOS or fails diagnostics, it’s not better.

---

## Extensions you should know

* **SARIMA $(p,d,q)\times(P,D,Q)_s$:** seasonal ARIMA with seasonal difference $D$ and seasonal period $s$.
* **ARIMAX / SARIMAX:** add exogenous regressors $X_t$ to capture calendar, promotions, weather, etc.
* **State-space / Kalman:** ARIMA recast; enables missing data handling, time-varying parameters, and smoother-based diagnostics.
* **ARFIMA:** fractional differencing to model long memory.
* **Regime-switching ARIMA:** different parameter sets by latent regime.

---

## Troubleshooting checklist

* **Residual ACF significant at short lags?** Increase $p$ or $q$ (not both at once), or reconsider differencing.
* **Large negative MA estimates near −1 with $d=1$?** Potential over-differencing.
* **Non-invertible MA or non-stationary AR warnings?** Re-specify orders; enforce constraints during estimation.
* **Prediction intervals too narrow/wide?** Suspect heteroskedasticity; consider GARCH or robust intervals.
* **Seasonal spikes in ACF/PACF?** Add seasonal difference $D=1$ and seasonal AR/MA terms.
* **Sudden fit degradation?** Look for breaks; add interventions or refit on a rolling window.

---

## How this theory guides AutoArimaExplorer

* Uses **standardized levels** for $d\ge 1$ and **log-returns** for $d=0$ to respect stationarity assumptions.
* Attempts multiple **estimation trials** (trend and constraint variants) and only keeps **converged, finite-BIC** fits.
* Provides **guardrails** (Ljung–Box on residuals and optionally on squared residuals).
* Offers three **selection lenses**: overall **Best-by-BIC**, per-$(d,q)$ **Best-by-q** (parsimonious stepwise path), and **Best-by-OOS** via rolling validation (RMSE/MAE/MAPE or Winkler for interval calibration).

Use ARIMA when you need interpretable, fast, and competitive short-horizon forecasts—and lean on diagnostics and OOS checks to keep yourself honest.

## Where the stats live (and what to read next)

This chapter focuses on **what ARIMA is and when it works**. The statistical machinery we rely on—tests, estimators, diagnostics, and selection criteria—is treated in depth in the companion chapter **[Statistical Concepts](../theory/statistical_conceps.md)**. If you want the math behind each knob we turn in AutoArimaExplorer, read that next. Specifically, it covers:

* **Stationarity & unit roots:** ADF, KPSS, and the practical meaning of $d$.
* **Correlation structure:** ACF/PACF definitions, sample estimators, and sampling variability.
* **Model adequacy tests:** Ljung–Box on residuals and on squared residuals (ARCH check).
* **Information criteria:** AIC, AICc, BIC—derivations, penalties, and when each is preferable.
* **Estimation details:** MLE for ARIMA, state-space likelihood, constraints (stationarity/invertibility).
* **Forecast uncertainty:** prediction vs. confidence intervals; what assumptions underpin them.
* **Error metrics:** RMSE/MAE/MAPE, coverage and **Winkler score** for prediction intervals.
* **Transformations & scaling:** log/Box–Cox, standardization, and their impact on inference.
* **Model selection trade-offs:** parsimony, overfitting, bias–variance, and tie-breaking rules.

Use this ARIMA chapter for the modeling storyline; use *Statistical Concepts* when you want the proofs, formulas, and the fine print behind each diagnostic and selection choice.
